# D2048

A blockchain blessed clone of the <del>no longer</del> famous game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048).

- Miners certified score! Show up your achivements to your friends with eternal, unquestionable records.
- Want something exciting? Play a game with 1 ETH bet and earn `score` finney (0.001ETH) back when the game ends.
Everything is done via holy smart contracts!
- All etherums you lose, if any, will be donated to charity. I promise. So feel free to play: if you win, you get money;
if you lose, you get karma. By the way, the game is fun!
